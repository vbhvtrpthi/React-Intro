What is REACT?

* It is basicaly a JS library which is used to develop UI or frontend.
* It is developed by FB

Why REACT?
* FAST -because of Diffing algo and virtual DOM
* Easy Event Handling (Provide shortcuts)
* It's small library, It's easy to learn
* It manage UI by states
   
Components
We divide our page into the components so that it's easy to manage and also our code looks clean.
* It is basicaly, isolated, reusable,independent piece of code.
* In REACT two types of Components:- Functional, class.

JSX-( Javascript XML)
* HTML+JS
* JSX allows us to write HTML inside JavaScript and place them in the DOM without using functions like appendChild() or createElement().
As stated in the official docs of REACT, JSX provides syntactic sugar for REACT.createElement() function

jsx -> Babel -> JS (Browser only understand js)

Rules For JSX
* whatever we will write  inside 'return()' is JSX
* Only a wrapper(Single div / React.Fragement / <> </>) should be returned.
* JS code can be written inside JSX using {}
* What is not allowed ?
   No Varibale decln
   No function decln  
   No loop(For,while,do-while)   ->  map,filter allowed
   if-else statement not allowed ->  Ternary operator allowed
   we can't render object        ->   but Array can be rendered

Static UI- Functional Component (But React has introduced hooks in 2019 through which states can be defined and functional Component can be also made Dynamic)

props are arguments passed into the react Components

Dynamic UI- class Component
* state- is a React obj which has info/properties of React component
* render- displays on UI
* Whenever state is changed, React will call the render method
, or re render the component
